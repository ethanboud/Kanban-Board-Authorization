## Description
This takes a pre-made web application regarding access to a Kanban Board using sequalize and postgres, react, and typescript. The additions to this code make it so that login authentication is required to gain access and try out the web application. This is accomplished through means of JWT Authentication and implementation.

## Installation
Download the files and open at the develop folder. Access to all files can be found here and alterations made as needed. Feel free to fork repository as well if desired. 

## Usage
To see how this works, it would be best to check out the deployed application. Please visit https://kanban-board-authorization.onrender.com to see the site in action. There is seeded data to be able to login. I recommend pressing F12 and view the local storage in google web developer tools. Upon attempting to login, an error will appear in the console as well as the webpage. Upon a successful login, the local storage will update to reflect a token that is used to authenticate the user for signing in. Try it for yourself but logging in as "JollyGuru" with password "password". 

## Contribution
Feel free to message for tips and tricks on JWT authentication processes or fork this repository and altering it to fit your own needs for authentication. 

## Test
Navigate to https://kanban-board-authorization.onrender.com and attempt to sign in. An error will appear. Then sign in with an already authenticated user ("JollyGuru" "password").
